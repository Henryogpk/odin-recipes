         <h2>Description</h2>
        <p> A smash burger is a type of burger where the beef patty is pressed 
            (or “smashed”) flat onto a hot griddle or skillet, creating a thin, 
            crispy-edged patty with a deep, caramelized crust. This method enhances 
            the flavor through a process called the Maillard reaction, giving it that
             delicious, slightly crunchy outside while keeping the inside juicy</p>
