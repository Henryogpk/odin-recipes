    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>A <strong>loaded baked potato</strong> is a fluffy, oven-baked potato that is split open and filled 
      with all the best savory toppings. Classic versions are packed with <strong>butter</strong>, <strong>cream</strong>, 
      <strong>shredded cheese</strong>, <strong>bacon bits</strong>, and <strong>green onions</strong> â€” making it a hearty, comforting
